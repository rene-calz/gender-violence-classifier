We worked with the ENDIREH (Encuesta Nacional sobre la Din√°mica de las Relaciones en los Hogares, 2021: https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/endireh/2021/#microdatos ) database. This included a whole range of variables and different types of gender violence. Because of this we chose to work only with physical violence. To choose the variables used for the classifiers we worked with Filter Method and Wrapped Method.
Finally, we used five different classifiers:Logistic Regression Classifier, Support Vector Machine, KNN (and 4-fold cross validation for tuning), Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Classifier. The accuracies obtained were between 86% and 88%.
